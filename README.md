# Neural Network from Scratch in Python

This is a simple implementation of a neural network built from scratch using only **Python + NumPy**.  
The network is trained to learn the AND logic gate using **forward propagation** and **backpropagation**.

## Features
- Sigmoid activation function
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation with gradient descent
- Learns AND gate truth table

## Results
Final predictions after training:

Input Output
0,0 ~0.01
0,1 ~0.05
1,0 ~0.04
1,1 ~0.97
